# LinearProgrammingGraph
This project will ask the user to give out the number of vertex in the graph, as well as the x coordinates for each of these vertex.
Then, with the use of linear programming, it will calculate based on each of their location if the graph
in question is a "Terrain" or not. Terrain by definition is a linear domain which involves the vertical and horizontal dimensions across it.
This is a work in progress.
